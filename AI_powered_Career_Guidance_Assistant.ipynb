        "\n",
        "Design and implement an **AI-powered Career Guidance Assistant** that helps students in **10th & 12th class** decide their career paths. The system must utilize **Sequential, Parallel, Branch, and Routing Chains** in LangChain to demonstrate understanding of multi-chain orchestration.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assistant should accept student details (subjects, marks, interests, and goals), process them through different chains, and finally generate a **Career Recommendation Report**.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. To gain hands-on experience in designing **Sequential, Parallel, Branch, and Routing chains**.\n",
        "2. To learn how to combine multiple reasoning pipelines into a unified assistant.\n",
        "3. To build a practical use case of **AI-driven decision-making** for student career guidance.\n",
